**Abstract** 

This research work explores the growing role of IoT devices in daily life and the increasing demand for secure data transmission in different sectors like healthcare, military, etc. Moreover, this study focuses on the recent advancements in lightweight cryptography and compares various encryption algorithms in an IoT environment using real-time data. Employing Message Queuing Telemetric Transport (MQTT) protocol, this research work assess the time of encryption, memory usage, and CPU usage as key parameters. By standardizing iterations, key width, and block length, this study aims to identify optimal encryption solutions for IoT applications.
